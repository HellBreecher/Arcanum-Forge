           Cleanup some of the build.gradle
           Start work on restructuring test mods. They are now treated as their own jars, as well as having their mods.toml auto-generated. No more mods.toml conflicts!

 - 48.0.13 Fix Slot Index for Inventory Ticking Items (#9736)
 - 48.0.12 Make default Entity.getAddPacket automatically use Forge's enhanced spawn packet if nessasary.
